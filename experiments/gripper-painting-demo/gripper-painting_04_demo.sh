# This is a bash script to showcase a simple example of how VaPAR is able to scope some causally-unconnected irrelevance that 
# FD alone cannot. 
# Running this from the root of the directory will produce two .sas files: one ('gripper_painting.sas') that is pruned only by 
# FD and another ('gripper-painting_scoped.sas') that is pruned by both FD and VaPAR. Notice how the latter file has less operators:
# these correspond to the operators that change the color (a causally-unconnected state-variable) of the different balls.
# Thus, VaPAR is able to prune operators corresponding to the causally-unconnected ball-color state-variable, while FD cannot.
